<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages,
  but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with
   a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.

  In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used
   to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser.
   Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line
  and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish
them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's
      default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to
      make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit
       styling is specified by the author of the page.
